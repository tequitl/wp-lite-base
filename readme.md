Rebuilding the Independent Web: WordPress + SQLite as a Return to Self-Hosted Freedom
"There was a time when the web felt more personalâ€”more human.

Before the age of monolithic platforms, algorithmic feeds, and one-size-fits-all solutions, the Bulletin Board System (BBS) thrived as a grassroots network of self-hosted communities. Sysops curated their own spaces, users connected directly, and creativity wasnâ€™t bound by corporate policies or opaque algorithms.

Today, convenience has come at a cost: dependence on large tech providers, bloated infrastructure, and a loss of that hands-on, independent spirit. But what if we could recapture the essence of the BBSâ€”not to reject modern tools, but to rebalance the web toward self-reliance and simplicity?

WordPress + SQLite: A Modern Take on the BBS Ethos
Lightweight & Portable â€“ SQLite eliminates the need for complex database servers, making WordPress easier to self-host on anything from a Raspberry Pi to a low-cost VPS.

Own Your Data â€“ No vendor lock-in, no mandatory cloud servicesâ€”just your content, stored in a single file you control.

Community-First â€“ With the right plugins, WordPress can become a forum, file repository, or blogâ€”all without relying on external platforms.

A Nod to the Past, Built for Today â€“ Retro themes and minimalist designs can evoke the charm of early BBSes while keeping the power of modern web standards.

Why This Matters
The beauty of the early web was its diversityâ€”small sites, quirky forums, and niche communities that existed outside the walled gardens. While todayâ€™s platforms offer undeniable convenience, they also centralize control. WordPress + SQLite is a step back toward a more independent web, where individuals and small groups can run their own spaces without unnecessary complexity.
